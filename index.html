           They had limited formal education at public schools and a technical high school, but his inventiveness and curiosity soon turned him into one of the signal success and survival stories in modern Australia. His remarkable entrepreneurial skills first appeared when he founded Smith Electronics in 1968 </p>
 
<p class="bodyText">By the time he sold the firm in 1982, Smith was a household name and his firm was a market leader in selling small electronic items, from calculators to computers. With the proceeds of the sale, he began a new career in philanthropy, exploration, and publishing.</p>



<p class="bodyText">With the proceeds of the sale, he began a new career in philanthropy, exploration, and publishing. Smith made the first solo helicopter flight around the world (1983), the first helicopter flight to the North Pole (1987), and the first flight around the world via the poles (1988). He served as head of the Civil Aviation Authority (1990–92 and 1997–99). In 1987 he purchased The Australian Encyclopaedia.</p>

Smith, who had become famous for flying his Sikorsky S76A helicopter under the Sydney Harbour Bridge, swapped the fixed-wing and helicopter aircraft for a hot-air balloon and entered a race to cross the Australian continent from west to east.</p>
